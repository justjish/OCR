This program that takes in multiple images of hand written letters and trains itself on the characteristics of each letter. Then it uses that trained information in order to identify the letters on a given image. 
•	Step 1: Training the program to be able to identify letters using a set of training images
•	Step 2: Use the now trained program to identify the letters on a given image 

In order to run a test of this program simple call on the "OCR_Recogition" function and pass an image file along with it. 

Try the following commands to test:

OCR_Recogition('test1.bmp')
OCR_Recogition('test2.bmp')
